# cmdnotes
cmdnotes is a barebones command line notes app, at present it only saves notes until you close the program.
========================================================================================================================================================================================

commands

-list lists all your notes with there numbers, example output:

-see is how you look at specific notes, after running this command it will ask you for a number and then print the note the number corresponds too

-exit exits the program with code 0, will save notes to file in future revisions

-mknote lets you add a note, normally just typing will do nothing

-delete lets you delete your notes

At present you have to compile the program yourself. to do this either clone the repository into visual studio 2017 or copy the cpp file into your own ide
and compile it there.
